*** Get the Facts ***

- Cosmetics additives, F.I.L. codes, CI-numbers, INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients), ingredient list, allergens, packaging codes... 
- Open Beauty Facts helps you to make sense of the fine print on products labels.
- You don't need to be a chemist and learn latin anymore to decypher an ingredient list :-)
- You can scan: aftershaves, body lotions, creams, deodorant, eyeliner, foundation, fragrance, lipstick, makeup, mask, perfume, shampoo, soap, shower gel, nail polish and much more…
- We think it can be useful for people with skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, eczema… to make better cosmetic choices.

*** Works well in any condition ***
- You can add new products, even if you don't have an Internet connection right now.
- The app loads only the strict necessary to reduce data and battery consumption
- You don't need a camera to look up a product. You can also type the barcode if you lack a camera or have an issue with it.

*** Your cosmetics, your data ***
- Your data is yours, and is never sent online
- You can use the app anonymously
- You can export your scan history

Note: Open Beauty Facts is being built, the site and the application are based on Open Food Facts and changes will be made to take into account the specificities of cosmetics.
