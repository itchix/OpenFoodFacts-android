Open Food Facts 是一個食品的開發資料庫，它提供食品的營養成份、原料、配料、過敏原、…等資訊。這些資訊的來源全來自於產品本身的外包裝，
For food, you can install Open Food Facts, for cosmetics, Open Beauty Facts, and for pet food, Open Pet Food Facts.

Yesterday morning, the Open Food Facts team woke up to a stunning revelation. 

Collecting the world's food, cosmetic and pet food was so passé. With the insane progress made over the past year, we must surely be close to completing our mission to collect all the food and cosmetic products in the world, right ?

So we set up to create not 1, but other 77000 separate new databases ! 

Open Products Facts will be an extremely ambitious project. Here are a few of them: 

Open Crayons Facts - The largest open database of coloring crayons

Open Miniature Food Facts - The largest open database of miniature food products

Open ??? Facts - The largest open database of ???

Tomorrow, we will select the 3 most sucessful databases, and we will start collecting all the matching products in the world.

Will it be trash cans, télécartes, or mobile phones database ? 

So if you like t-shirts, cooking books, origami paper or snow globes, start scanning using the Open Products Facts Android app on Google Play
