▶ 尋找和比較超過80萬個產品 - You can easily compare as many products as you want, side by side by simply scanning them. ▶ And good for the planet! - The carbon impact of your food

The app allows to view the over 600 pet food products already contained in the free and open database Open Pet Food Facts, and also to add pictures and data for missing products.
The app is collaborative. If we don't have the product, you can add pictures and data to get the Nutri-Score and NOVA score on food processing.

In short, we're kind of "the Wikipedia of food", as many have nicknamed the project. Open Food Facts has enabled the creation of over 100 apps like Date Limite, Yuka or FoodVisor.

Open Food Facts 是一個食品的開發資料庫，它提供食品的營養成份、原料、配料、過敏原、…等資訊。這些資訊的來源全來自於產品本身的外包裝，
