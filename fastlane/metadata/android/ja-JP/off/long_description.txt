▶ Find & Compare more than 800.000 products

The app allows to view the over 600 pet food products already contained in the free and open database Open Pet Food Facts, and also to add pictures and data for missing products.
The app is collaborative. If we don't have the product, you can add pictures and data to get the Nutri-Score and NOVA score on food processing.

In short, we're kind of "the Wikipedia of food", as many have nicknamed the project. Open Food Facts has enabled the creation of over 100 apps like Date Limite, Yuka or FoodVisor.

Open Food Facts は、食品の原材料、アレルゲン、栄養成分表、および製品ラベルで見ることができるすべての情報のオープンデータベースです。
